= SPEC-1: AI-Supported Animation Software
:sectnums:
:toc:

== Background

The process of creating animations with Manim is powerful but time-consuming, requiring precise scripting and mathematical transformations. While tools like Adobe After Effects offer intuitive interfaces, they lack Manim’s mathematically precise control.

This project aims to bridge the gap between scripting-based animation and creative sketching by introducing an AI-assisted workflow. The software will allow users to sketch vector-based shapes and provide text-based prompts, which an AI model will convert into Manim animation scripts. 

Initially, the proof-of-concept (PoC) version will focus on:
- **Targeting experienced Manim programmers**, ensuring they can refine AI-generated scripts.
- **Generating raw Manim code only**, without real-time preview adjustments.
- **Providing a simple sketchpad interface**, allowing users to draw vector shapes that serve as a basis for AI-generated animations.


== Requirements

The proof-of-concept version of the AI-supported animation software will focus on core functionality and essential usability. Features are prioritized using MoSCoW categorization.

**Must-Have (M):**
- A **vector-based sketchpad** allowing users to draw basic shapes (lines, circles, polygons).
- A **text prompt input** for users to describe animation behavior.
- **AI-powered Manim code generation** based on sketches and prompts.
- A **code editor** where users can refine the generated Manim script.
- **Export functionality** to save the generated Manim script for execution.

**Should-Have (S):**
- A **basic UI similar to Adobe Illustrator/Inkscape**, focused on simplicity.
- **Support for layers or groups** to organize vector elements.
- **Undo/Redo functionality** in the sketchpad.

**Could-Have (C):**
- **SVG import support** for predefined vector shapes.
- **Manim preview integration** (but not real-time rendering).
- **AI-based refinements**, such as auto-smoothing of paths.

**Won’t-Have (W) (for PoC phase):**
- Real-time animation previews.
- Advanced animation timelines or keyframing.
- Deep learning-based motion inference.
